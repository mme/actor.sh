# actor.sh

Manages multiple Claude/Codex agents running in isolated git worktrees.

## Project structure

```
src/actor/               # Python package
  cli.py                 # argparse CLI, command dispatch
  commands.py            # Command implementations (cmd_new, cmd_run, cmd_list, etc.)
  db.py                  # SQLite database layer (~/.actor/actor.db)
  types.py               # Dataclasses: Actor, Run, Status, Config
  interfaces.py          # ABCs: Agent, GitOps, ProcessManager
  errors.py              # Exception hierarchy
  git.py                 # Real git operations
  process.py             # Real process manager (kill, is_alive)
  agents/
    claude.py            # ClaudeAgent — spawns claude CLI sessions
    codex.py             # CodexAgent — spawns codex CLI sessions

  claude-config.md       # Claude agent config reference
  codex-config.md        # Codex agent config reference
tests/
  test_actor.py          # All tests (unittest)
spec/
  V2.md                  # V2 vision (MCP server, channels, dashboard, plugin)
  PLAN-STAGE1.md         # Stage 1 implementation plan (minimal MCP server)
```

## Development setup

### Install with uv

```bash
uv sync                    # creates .venv, installs in editable mode
uv tool install -e .       # makes `actor` globally available
```

Changes to `src/actor/` take effect immediately — no reinstall needed.
Re-run `uv tool install -e .` only when adding new console scripts to `[project.scripts]`.

### Symlink the skill for global use

```bash
ln -s /Users/mme/Projects/actor.sh/main/skills/actor ~/.claude/skills/actor
```

## Running tests

```bash
uv run python -m unittest tests.test_actor
```

Tests use in-memory SQLite and fake implementations (FakeAgent, FakeGit, FakeProcessManager) — no real processes or git repos needed.

## Key runtime paths

- **Database:** `~/.actor/actor.db` (SQLite, auto-created)
- **Worktrees:** `~/.actor/worktrees/<actor-name>/`
- **Claude logs:** `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-dir>/<session-id>.jsonl`

## Architecture notes

- Commands are pure functions that take a `Database` + interfaces and return strings. Side effects go through the `Agent`, `GitOps`, and `ProcessManager` ABCs — this is what makes everything testable with fakes.
- No dependencies beyond Python 3.9+ stdlib for the core package.
- Actors spawned by other actors are tracked via the `parent` column. The `ACTOR_NAME` env var is set before launching an agent, so child actors automatically record their parent. `discard` cascades recursively — stops running children, then deletes.
- DB migrations run on open (see `db.py` after schema creation). New columns are added via `ALTER TABLE` if missing.
